The GTFS is generated using two sources:

- The GTFS files for bus lines are taken from https://opendata.iiitd.edu.in/data/static/. These GTFS files are then converted to MATSim transit schedule.
- The MATSim Transit schedules for Delhi Metro lines are converted to MATSim transit schedules using OSM data (overpass-turbo). For this, look on https://github.com/amit2011/pt2matsim
